								<p>Every second counts when it comes to saving lives. We need enough fire stations to be open so they can help us quickly in our time of need.</p>
								<p>In just 1 year, the time it takes for fire engines to reach those in need has increased to almost <strong><u>9 minutes</u></strong>! That's up by almost 50% compared to the year before.</p>
								<p>Why should we worry? Well according to <a href="https://www.fireengineering.com/firefighting/survivability-profiling-how-long-can-victims-survive-in-a-fire-2/" target="_blank">Fire Engineering</a>, if those in need don't get support within 10 minutes they'll almost certainly die!</p>
